Build type-safe, consistent, themeable React apps without sacrificing performance and compatability.

A TypeScript compatible and optimized fork of [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system) v3.

This library is planned to be rewritten from the ground up. Expect everything to break.

## Local Development

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

The package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).

By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
